# Flappy Learner â€“ Summer of Code

Flappy Learner is a Summer of Code project focused on building a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to play the Flappy Bird game. The project is structured to help students learn the theory and practice of AI, ML, and RL in a gradual, hands-on way.

## Project Timeline

Week 1: Introduction to AI/ML and Python Libraries  
- Overview of AI, ML, and RL  
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning  
- Introduction to libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

Week 2: Introduction to Neural Networks  
- Gradient descent, model evaluation  
- Neural network architecture and backpropagation  
- Loss functions and intro to PyTorch

Week 3: Markov Decision Processes  
- Markov chains and MDP components  
- Value functions, Bellman equations  
- Formulating RL problems using MDPs

Week 4: Buffer Week  
- Time to catch up, revise, or revisit previous topics

Week 5: Algorithms for Solving RL  
- Monte Carlo methods and Temporal Difference (TD) learning  
- SARSA vs Q-learning  
- Exploration strategies like epsilon-greedy and softmax

Week 6: Deep Reinforcement Learning  
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN), experience replay, target networks  
- Policy gradient methods, REINFORCE  
- PPO and TRPO algorithms

Week 7: Flappy Bird Environment Development  
- Build the game using Pygame  
- Define state space, actions, and rewards  
- Implement `reset()`, `step()`, and `render()` for RL compatibility

Week 8: Agent Training and Evaluation  
- Train the RL agent using DQN or PPO  
- Track performance and visualize learning  
- Save models and test gameplay

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pygame  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

## Objective

To gain a strong foundation in reinforcement learning by applying theoretical knowledge to build and train an agent that can learn to play Flappy Bird from scratch.
